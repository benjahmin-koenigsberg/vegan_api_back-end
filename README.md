## Lessons Learned

- I learned that the order routes are coded can make a difference, which function will get precedence and which route may not even work

```
ExpressJS calculates the priority of a route based on the specificity of its path and the order by which they are declared. Routes are ordered from the most specific to the less specific one.
```

- I learned about unsigned upload presetes to use Cloudinary's API to upload images from React.
- I learned a little about using th React Syntax Highlighter library

## Whats next

- Use Jest or React's testing library to write tests for the code
- Use chrome accessibility tools or Lighthouse to improve accessibilityof the API
- Refactor code to be DRYer and more organized
- Add feature to get memes dynamically rendered to size from HTTP requests
- Promote API, publish to RapidAPI and ensure that developers know about it
